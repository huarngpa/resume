        \resumeItem{SnowTube}
          {Architected and led the development of SnowTube, a low-latency, Flink-like streaming and clustering system powering EC2's core platform, processing petabyte-scale EC2 resource events (e.g., Virts, VPC, AMI). Achieved sub-second latency and 99.99\% uptime. Currently leading a project leveraging this system to save \$1M annually by optimizing compute resource usage. Migrating streaming infrastructure from custom JournalDB technology to SNS/SQS, enabling unlimited fanout and throughput. Spearheading a new service (and team) to build Kafka clusters for SnowTube and the EC2 organization.}
        \resumeItem{OpenSearch Adoption}
          {Led EC2's migration from MySQL to OpenSearch, managing self-hosted clusters to support ad-hoc NoSQL queries for 10+ resources (AMIs, VPCs, etc.). Enabled AWSâ€™s strategy to deprecate MySQL clusters. Ensured latency-sensitive queries were the same or better than MySQL, enhancing platform scalability and performance.}
        \resumeItem{Innovative Contributions}
          {Leveraged frontend expertise to guide adjacent EC2 teams in building robust React applications, upskilled 2+ team members. Developed RAG and agentic applications to query OpenSearch and internal documentation, improving user interaction and team efficiency for internal EC2 teams. Handling these projects outside core responsibilities, when time permits.}

It's purpose is to power Amazon's digital catalog services by aggregating and caching product metadata from many downstream systems. We maintain a proprietary transformation technology (``dockets'') that allows customers the ability to query and transform product metadata into a ``product'' for their business. I assumed the role as tech lead for the team, designed and implemented new features (1:n offers, collections, etc.), and helped drive down the operational burdens on the team.}
        \resumeItem{Collections}
          {Collections is a Java, Gremlin, Neptune, RPC service that enhances Amazon's digital catalog services by providing customers and services a means to build relationships amongst data (via graph database). This technology currently powers Alexa's skill categorization service, but we intended it to handle many other use-cases like product-bundling, classifications, hierarchies, and graph traversals. My role on this project was to course-correct, redesign/refactor, and operationalize the system.}
        \resumeItem{LaunchPad}
          {LaunchPad is a TypeScript, NextJS, Java, GraphQL, RPC service that allows Amazon teams to develop custom, product detail pages using JSON and code artifacts. This service speeds up delivery and development of detail pages from quarters to mere weeks. My contributions towards this project is leading both frontend and backend development of the service, as well as leading customer onboarding and delivery into production.}

          {Performance is a Scala, Lagom, Akka, Kafka, SQS service that provides cashflow and performance calculations to our users (serves up more than 450 RPS under peak load). Refactored much of the core logic for money-weighted return calculations, dividend and trade cash flows, re-migrated tens of millions of records, and made the system more stable by handling network failures better and refactoring parts of the app to use a message-based architecture.}
        \resumeItem{Fraud}
          {Fraud is domain that is housed in multiple different backend services. The solutions I have helped build include: Plaid integrations to get external banking information; Socure integrations to risk-score users when we onboard them; designed and developed a rules-pattern for ACH transfers in/out of M1. All solutions described here use the following technologies: Scala, Lagom, Akka, and Kafka.}
        \resumeItem{Broker}
          {Broker is a service that accounts for a user's cash, positions, and account information. It is responsible for more than 80\% of revenues and is a very critical and complex domain. As a core developer on this system, I have used Lagom and Akka to add new, event-sourced entities to the system (ie. most recently IRA activity and business rules) and resolve issues by hardening the system via bugfix and/or writing additional reactive or batch-based logic.}
